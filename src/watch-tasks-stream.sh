# Streaming task watcher — the canonical task-detection path.
#
# Runs fswatch indefinitely and emits ONE line per new task file appearance.
# Designed to be invoked via Claude Code's `Monitor` tool, which streams
# stdout lines as per-event notifications without process-restart cycles.
#
# Replaces the one-shot `watch-tasks.sh` (retired 2026-05-14) — that one
# exited on first event so the caller had to restart it; this one stays
# alive for the lifetime of the CLI session.
#
# Output format per event:
#   TASK_FILE: <basename>
# Plus an INITIAL_SCAN block at startup for any pre-existing files:
#   TASK_FILE: <basename>  (one per line)
#
# The agent reads the named files via the Read tool when notifications
# arrive — no need to inline file contents in stdout (Monitor's 200ms
# batching window would group multi-line content awkwardly).

# → repo-relative fallback. The SUTANDO_WORKSPACE branch matches what every
# bridge does (discord-bridge.py, telegram-bridge.py, dm-result.py — see
# PRs #708/#720/#722/#723) — without it, the bridges write tasks to the
# workspace but the watcher polls the repo's tasks/, so owner DMs land but
# the agent never sees them. Diagnosed 2026-05-15 (~3 dropped DMs over
# 17 min before the workaround restart).

# `dirname "$path"` == `$TASKS_DIR_ABS` fails when /tmp is symlinked to

# Stream subsequent events. -l 0.5 = 500ms latency batch (fswatch coalesces
# burst events). --event Created --event Renamed catches new file
# appearance whether it lands as a fresh write or a rename-into-place.
#
# TWO filters before emit:
#
# 1. Parent-dir match: the macOS FSEvents monitor (fswatch's default) is
#    recursive even without `-r`, so a rename from `tasks/X.txt` to
#    `tasks/archive/.../X.txt` fires events for BOTH the source AND the
#    destination — and the destination path is in a subdir we don't care
#    about. We only want events for files that landed AS A DIRECT CHILD
#    of $TASKS_DIR. `dirname "$path"` against the absolute watched dir
#    catches this. Caught 2026-05-03 #2: archives in tasks/archive/2026-05/
#    were re-firing TASK_FILE: <name> with a different path but the same
#    basename, making the agent re-process every just-archived task.
#
# 2. Existence check: fswatch fires Renamed events on BOTH ends of a
#    rename — including the source path AFTER the file has moved out.
#    `[ -f "$path" ]` filters those rename-OUT-of-watched-dir events.
#    Caught 2026-05-03 #1 (PR #572).
